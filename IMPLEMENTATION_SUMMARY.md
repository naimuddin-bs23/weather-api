# DevOps Task - Complete Implementation Summary

## ✅ Task Completion Status

All requirements have been successfully implemented:

### 1. REST API Development ✅
- **Node.js REST API** with Express.js framework
- **`/api/hello` endpoint** returning:
  - `hostname`: Server hostname (configurable via environment)
  - `datetime`: Current date/time in YYMMDDHHmm format
  - `version`: Application version from package.json
  - `weather`: Real-time weather data for Dhaka from OpenWeatherMap API
- **`/api/health` endpoint** with comprehensive health checks:
  - API service status
  - Weather API reachability
  - Proper HTTP status codes (200 for healthy, 503 for degraded)

### 2. Weather Integration ✅
- **OpenWeatherMap API** integration for Dhaka weather data
- **Fallback mechanism** when weather API is unavailable
- **Error handling** with graceful degradation
- **Temperature in Celsius** as required

### 3. Containerization ✅
- **Optimized Dockerfile** with security best practices:
  - Alpine Linux base image
  - Non-root user execution
  - Multi-stage build optimization
  - Security hardening
- **Development Dockerfile** with hot reload support
- **Docker Compose** configuration for both development and production

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline ✅
- **GitHub Actions workflow** with:
  - Automated testing on push/PR
  - Docker image building on release
  - Multi-platform support (AMD64/ARM64)
  - Registry push with proper tagging
- **Release-based deployment** triggers
- **Version synchronization** between releases and API responses

### 5. Zero-Downtime Deployment ✅
- **Blue-green deployment** strategy
- **Health check validation** before switching
- **Automatic rollback** on failure
- **Load balancer configuration** with Nginx
- **Deployment script** with comprehensive error handling

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

## 🔧 Usage Instructions

### Local Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Docker Development
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Zero-Downtime Deployment
```bash
./deploy.sh v1.0.0
```

## 🧪 Testing

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ API endpoint functionality
- ✅ Response format validation
- ✅ Health check behavior
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Docker build process

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### GET /api/hello
Returns system information and weather data:
```json
{
  "hostname": "server1",
  "datetime": "2412011430",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "weather": {
    "dhaka": {
      "temperature": "25",
      "temp_unit": "c"
    }
  }
}
```

### GET /api/health
Returns health status:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-01T14:30:00.000Z",
  "services": {
    "api": "healthy",
    "weather_api": "healthy"
  }
}
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The pipeline automatically:
1. **Tests** the application on every push/PR
2. **Builds** Docker images on release creation
3. **Pushes** images to Docker registry with proper tags
4. **Deploys** with zero-downtime strategy
5. **Validates** version synchronization

## 📋 Next Steps for Production

1. **Set up GitHub repository** and push code
2. **Configure secrets** in GitHub Actions:
   - `DOCKER_USERNAME`
   - `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
   - `WEATHER_API_KEY`
3. **Create first release** to trigger CI/CD pipeline
4. **Monitor deployment** and health checks
5. **Set up monitoring** and alerting
